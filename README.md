# Charity Analysis Using Neural Networks
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to help the fictional Alphabet Soup foundation predict if a charitable organization will be successful if it is funded by the Alphabet Soup foundation.

## Results
- Data Preprocessing
  - What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
  - What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
  - What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
- Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
  - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  - What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
